Java program showing implementation of Tim sort.

Tim sort is a sorting algorithm based on the combination of Insertion sort and Merge sort.

This invovles dividing the given array into smaller blocks known as 'Runs'. These runs are sorted using insertion sort and then merged together using merge sort to obtain the final sorted array.
